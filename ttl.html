However, we do not have much choice in determining the color of the article we send.  That's why Discord stands apart from other group messaging apps altogether.  This young software has numerous other advantages, of course, but deciding on font color is a charming feature. 

By the way, at the top of the list are, of course, the brand colors of the Discord logo. As you know, each Brand follows a specific color palette. These colors are used in all advertising and design works of the brand. Colors are the identity of the brand." maxlength="0"></textarea>
